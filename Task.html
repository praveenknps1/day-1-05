                    <h2>Cricket</h2>
                    The India men's national cricket team represents India in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.

The team played its first international match on 25 June 1932 in a Test against England at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. India's first Test victory was in 1952, and success was limited in the team's first fifty years of international cricket, with only 35 wins in 196 Tests.[10] However, they gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of the Indian spin quartet, and players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, and Kapil Dev. In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI debut against England in 1974 and its T20I debut against South Africa in 2006.

                    <h2>Kabbadi</h2>
                    Kabaddi (/kəbədi/) is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players, originating in ancient India.[2] The objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to the game after each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.

It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.[3] It is the second most popular and viewed sport in India after cricket.[2][4] It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.
